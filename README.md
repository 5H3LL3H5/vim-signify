# vim-signify

This plugin started as a port of GitGutter, a famous plugin for Sublime Text 2.
It shows all added, deleted and changed lines since the last commit via Vim its
sign column.

It's fast, highly configurable and well documented.

Features:

- supports git (other DVCS will follow)
- apart from signs there is also optional line highlighting
- you can toggle the plugin per buffer
- fully configurable through global variables
- good documentation

- quick developer response! :-)

Limits exist only in your mind! Vim on!
