# vim-signify

Or just: sy

This plugin started as a port of GitGutter, a famous plugin for Sublime Text 2.
It shows all added, deleted and changed lines since the last commit via Vim its
sign column.

![Example:signify in action](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify/raw/master/signify.png)

It's fast, highly configurable and well documented.

Features:

- supports git, mercurial
- apart from signs there is also optional line highlighting
- you can toggle the plugin per buffer
- fully configurable through global variables
- good documentation

- quick developer response! :-)

Limits exist only in your mind! Vim on!

## Installation

I suggest using tpope's plain and awesome pathogen:

- https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

Afterwards, just clone vim-signify into ~/.vim/bundle/.

## Usage

`:h signify`
