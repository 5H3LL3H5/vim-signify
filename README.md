# vim-signify

This plugin started as a port of GitGutter, a famous plugin for Sublime Text 2.

It's fast, highly configurable and well documented.

Features:

- shows added, deleted and changed lines since the last commit via Vim's sign
  column
- supports git (other DVCS will follow)
- you can toggle the plugin per buffer
- fully configurable through global variables in vimrc
- good documentation

- quick developer response! ;)

Limits exist only in your mind! Vim on!

## Installation
